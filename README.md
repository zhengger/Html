Study Html in 3 months. From 1.26.2017
Hi All,
I'm so happy to be here. I'a a newbie programmer and I will devote myself into programming. Programming for me is a way to save myself. After trying many ways of making live, I think programing is the lowest price for a normal person to fullfill himself in 20 years.

Now I will study Html-CSS in W3 in next 10 days.

Best
Frank
